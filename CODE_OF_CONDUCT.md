# Contributor Covenant Code of Conduct

## Our Pledge

We as members, contributors, and leaders pledge to make participation in our
community a harassment-free experience for everyone, regardless of age, body
size, visible or invisible disability, ethnicity, sex characteristics, gender
identity and expression, level of experience, education, socio-economic status,
nationality, personal appearance, race, religion, or sexual identity
and orientation.

We pledge to act and interact in ways that contribute to an open, welcoming,
diverse, inclusive, and healthy community.

## Our Standards

Examples of behavior that contributes to a positive environment for our
community include:

* Demonstrating empathy and kindness toward other people
* Being respectful of differing opinions, viewpoints, and experiences
* Giving and gracefully accepting constructive feedback
* Accepting responsibility and apologizing to those affected by our mistakes,
  and learning from the experience
* Focusing on what is best not just for us as individuals, but for the
  overall community

Examples of unacceptable behavior include:

* The use of sexualized language or imagery, and sexual attention or
  advances of any kind
* Trolling, insulting or derogatory comments, and personal or political attacks
* Public or private harassment
* Publishing others' private information, such as a physical or email
  address, without their explicit permission
* Other conduct which could reasonably be considered inappropriate in a
  professional setting

## Enforcement Responsibilities

Community leaders are responsible for clarifying and enforcing our standards of
acceptable behavior and will take appropriate and fair corrective action in
response to any behavior that they deem inappropriate, threatening, offensive,
or harmful.

Community leaders have the right and responsibility to remove, edit, or reject
comments, commits, code, wiki edits, issues, and other contributions that are
not aligned to this Code of Conduct, and will communicate reasons for moderation
decisions when appropriate.

## Scope

This Code of Conduct applies within all community spaces, and also applies when
an individual is officially representing the community in public spaces.
Examples of representing our community include using an official e-mail address,
posting via an official social media account, or acting as an appointed
representative at an online or offline event.

## Enforcement

Instances of abusive, harassing, or otherwise unacceptable behavior may be
reported to the community leaders responsible for enforcement at
iamashley@duck.com (E-mail) https://discord.gg/pfKSQ3pMfW (Discord server) https://matrix.to/#/#poke:vern.cc (matrix space) and https://rvlt.gg/poke (revolt server).

All complaints will be reviewed and investigated promptly and fairly.

All community leaders are obligated to respect the privacy and security of the
reporter of any incident.

2. Terms

NOTE: The Contributor Covenant Code of Conduct already includes provisions on some of these issues. Our intention is to provide a more defined and explicit statement regarding these prohibitions to ensure a clear and inclusive community environment.

YOU ARE ABSOLUTELY AND UNEQUIVOCALLY PROHIBITED FROM EDITING, REMOVING, OR ALTERING THE TERMS OF THIS FILE IN ANY WAY, SHAPE, OR FORM. FURTHERMORE, ONLY ASHLEY (THE AUTHOR) IS PERMITTED TO EDIT THIS CODE OF CONDUCT. YOU MAY NOT, UNDER ANY CIRCUMSTANCES, REMOVE THIS FILE FROM YOUR FORK OF POKETUBE.

If you do not wish to adhere to this conduct in your fork of Poketube, you have the option to utilize alternative codes of conduct instead. However, if you do not wish to adopt the alternative code of conduct, please feel free to contact us and explain your reasons for wanting to remove this file.

It is of paramount importance to emphasize that the promotion or glorification of anti-immigrant sentiments, the alignment with far-right ideologies, Islamophobia, or any form of religious discrimination is entirely and unequivocally prohibited within the scope of Poketube. We maintain a zero-tolerance stance on such content, which includes any material that discriminates against immigrants, promotes hatred or hostility towards religious groups, or actively supports extremist beliefs associated with far-right ideologies. This stance is unwavering and non-negotiable.

We believe in fostering an environment that is inclusive, respectful, and free from discrimination or the promotion of extremist ideologies. As such, any content found in violation of this prohibition will be addressed promptly and appropriately.

THE CLARITY AND FORCE OF THIS STATEMENT ARE INTENDED TO LEAVE NO ROOM FOR AMBIGUITY: ANTI-IMMIGRANT SENTIMENTS, FAR-RIGHT IDEOLOGIES, ISLAMOPHOBIA, RELIGIOUS DISCRIMINATION, MISOGYNY, AND SEXISM ARE STRICTLY OFF-LIMITS AND WILL NOT BE TOLERATED WITHIN OUR COMMUNITY. OUR COMMITMENT TO MAINTAINING A RESPECTFUL AND INCLUSIVE ATMOSPHERE EXTENDS TO ALL, REGARDLESS OF THEIR BACKGROUND, BELIEFS, OR IDENTITY.

These terms may be subject to change, and any updates will be communicated to the Poketube community. Changes to these terms will be communicated to users.

**3. Application of GNU Kind Communication Policy**

These terms also apply the principles outlined in the [GNU Kind Communication Policy](https://www.gnu.org/philosophy/kind-communication.html), which encourage respectful and inclusive communication within the Poketube community.

It is crucial to note that we respect the diverse opinions and beliefs of our users.
