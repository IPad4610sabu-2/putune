                Information Not Collected &nbsp;
               </h3>

              <p>
            When you watch a video at PokeTube, we don't know who you are and there is no way to tie the videos you are wathcing.
When you access a website, your Web browser automatically sends information about your computer. (e.g. your User agent and IP address.)<br><br>

Because this information could be used to link you to your peronsal information, we do not log (store) it at all. This is a very unusual practice, but we feel it is an important step to protect your privacy.

It is unusual for a reason. most server software auto-stores this information, so you have to go out of your way not to store it. At PokeTube, no cookies are used by default.<br><br>
          
At PokeTube,we dont collect your personal information or share it. We dont collect your IP address. Your device metadata (e.g. device resolution,OS Info etc.) is not collected in anyway. 
            
              </p>

               <h3 class="hd-md">
                Information Collected &nbsp;
               </h3>

               <p>
                     We use a tool called <a href="https://piwik.org">Matomo</a> to collect "information." you migth see requests to <code >t.poketube.fun</code> while watching a video. we use clear gifs to collect "Information." This Migth Look as an tracking technique,but its not. it allows us to see how much poketube users watched this video,we dont collect your ip or any of your personal information while making this. we promise.  Since piwik collects alot of information from you by default (See:https://matomo.org/tracking-personal-data-with-matomo/) in our istance of piwik,we dont collect information at all. every information collection method is closed on our istance.<br><br> Your ip adress is not collected,at all. but since matomo requires you to collect ip adress information,we made it so it does not collect any (and we mean any) information thats tied w/ you.  <br><br> This is of course not the kind of behavior that you would expect from a privacy concerned website (using clear gifs to collect "anonymous" stats). but we promise that we are not tracking you or collecting any information from you. fingers crossed.<br><br> We also save searches, but again, not in a personally identifiable way, as we do not store IP addresses or unique User agent strings. We use aggregate, non-personal search data.
              </p>

<p>If you care about privacy, you might also want to check out these other YouTube Front-ends that take it seriously by default.</p>
<ul>
	<li><a href="https://invidious.io/">Invidious</a> [<a href="https://github.com/iv-org/invidious">Source Code</a>] </li>
  <li><a href="https://tube.kuylar.dev/">LightTube</a> [<a href="https://gitlab.com/kuylar/lighttube">Source Code</a>]</li>
</ul>
                 <p>Each One does things a bit differently in terms of privacy. However, none store your personal information by default and they are free software, which make them all pretty safe in our opinion.</p>
